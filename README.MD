**Resume** 

This project is about to test a Pumpkin Battery Module 2 pack using Arduino to simulate a communication with SCPI Commands. The project was developed in C language, using Arduino IDE and I2C bus communicatio in the Master and Slave system. The Arduino models used was Arduino UNO and Arduino DUE. The SCPI commands was followed from provided reference manual in https://pumpkin-space-systems.gitlab.io/public/software-reference-manual/. 



**Used Tools** 

* SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments): is a communication protocol mainly used to control and measure equipments. SCPI commands consist of text encoded in ASCII and separated by a colon (:) and are usually easy to understand and low complexity, because the SCPI standard was developed many years ago and covers a multitude of instrumentation equipment, including those with low data processing capacity. The commands implemented in this project are following Pumpkin reference manual and are found in the table located in [BatteryCommunicationSCPI](https://github.com/felipemoraissoares/BatteryCommunicationSCPI)/[SCPI_Commands](https://github.com/felipemoraissoares/BatteryCommunicationSCPI/tree/main/SCPI_Commands)

* Arduino: Was used two types of Arduino in this project 

  * Arduino Uno:
